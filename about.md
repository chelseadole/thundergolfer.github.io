### Professional

I am a Staff Software Engineer at [Brex](https://www.brex.com/), and the tech lead of the Data Storage team. As part of Data Storage, I provide organizational guidance about database access and system design, build automation and infrastructure, perform query optimization across hundreds of databases, and more.

Beyond my 9-5, I am an avid public speaker in the Postgres world. I love nerding out about technical writing, exchanging on-call war stories, and the zen feeling of marking JIRA tickets as "Complete".

### Personal

I was born and raised in Seattle, and recently moved back following several years living across multiple continents. In my spare time, I love to read, spend time with my friends and family, listen to podcasts, DJ jazz music, and dance lindy hop.

Some of my favorite things include: big fuzzy dogs, the jazz standard "Moonglow", hosting parties, anything Legend of Zelda, solo travel, coffee, and people who write good documentation.
